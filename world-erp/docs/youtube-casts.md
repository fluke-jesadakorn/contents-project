# YouTube Series — Cast & Flow Map

Trimmed demo footprint. Each episode uses one persona + one flow. Six personas, four departments, eight tiles in active rotation.

## Active personas

| ID | Name | Dept | RBAC | Episodes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | John Staff | Development | L2A | 1, 2, 5 |
| 4 | Emily Manager | Finance & Account | L3 | 2, 4 |
| 15 | Charles Executive | Executive | L4 | 2, 4, 5 |
| 20 | Alex Admin | IT | L4 | 3, 5 |
| 27 | Andrew Supervisor | Finance & Account | L2A | 2, 5 |
| 29 | Brian Admin | Executive | L4 | 3, 5 |

Sign in via the persona menu (top right). Removed users return `user not found`.

## Departments

| Group | Users | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Development | John Staff | Cross-department reporting to Andrew (Finance) |
| Finance & Account | Emily, Andrew | Heaviest transactional dept |
| Executive | Charles, Brian | Cockpit + CEO override |
| IT | Alex Admin | RBAC matrix, AI settings |

## Episode map

| # | Title | Persona | Flow | Tiles |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Upload + Extract | John Staff | Drag PDF/PNG → OCR → expense draft | `/submit-expense` |
| 2 | Approval Ladder | John → Andrew → Emily → Charles | Submit → supervisor → head → exec | `/approve-expense` |
| 3 | RBAC Matrix | Alex Admin | Edit cell, see cascade | `/org-chart`, `/settings` |
| 4 | Override + Ledger | Charles | CEO override → journal posting | `/override-queue`, `/ledger` |
| 5 | Notifications | John, Andrew, Emily | Submit + approve + see bell | `/summary` |

## Cross-slice summary tile

`/summary` shows activity counts sliced four ways:

- **By Feature** — row counts per table (expenses, slips, PRs, notifications, etc.)
- **By Department** — users + expenses + slips + approvals per dept group
- **By RBAC Group** — role coverage per module group
- **By Persona** — per-user activity across all features

Gated by `tile-summary` permission (currently `L4 read`). Useful for the "show me everything" shot.
