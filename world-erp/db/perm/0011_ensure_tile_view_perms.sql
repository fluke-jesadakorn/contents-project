-- World ERP — ensure every rbac.tiles row has a matching perm.permissions row.
-- Future features ship their own permission in a migration; this seed only
-- backfills what the tile catalog needs today.
-- HR cannot create permissions (append-only catalog) — that's enforced by
-- the absence of POST /api/perm/permissions.
