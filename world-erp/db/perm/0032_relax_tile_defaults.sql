-- World ERP — relax over-strict tile-gate defaults + surface the new /tiles
-- admin tool as a Hub tile.
--
-- Background: 0031_tile_access_gates.sql backfilled required_level from
-- `MIN(users.staff_level) + 1` of role-holders, which produced required_level=2
-- for nearly every non-workflow tile. That's too strict — managers (L3) couldn't
-- see ledger, cockpit, policy, audit, etc. This migration:
--   1. Bumps non-workflow L2 tiles to L3 (manager+) so the day-to-day UX works.
--   2. Workflow tiles (submit, my-prs, approve, search-coa) become fully public
--      (NULL/NULL) — any staff in any dept can submit. HR can tighten per-tile
--      via /tiles if they want dept-scoped workflows.
--   3. Adds a `tile-gates` Hub tile under the HR group so admins can find /tiles
--      without typing the URL. Gate = L3, any dept.
--
-- Reversible: revert perm.tiles to prior values; the tile-gates row
-- can be removed with: DELETE FROM perm.tiles WHERE id = 'tile-gates';
