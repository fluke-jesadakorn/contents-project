-- World ERP — give the permissions tile its own dedicated permission.
-- Previously aliased to tile:org_chart:view (HR Manager has it via the org_chart tile),
-- but tile visibility should be explicit: a tile is visible iff the actor has
-- the perm declared in rbac.tiles.required_permission.
--
-- Grant tile:permissions:view to all the personas that already had access to
-- the legacy "permissions" tile (CEO/CFO/admin/hr_manager).
