-- Backfill: copy existing domain_events into per-user notifications inbox.
-- Idempotent: skipped if the same domain_event id is already fanned out
-- for the same recipient + ref (best-effort dedup via row check).
--
-- Recipient routing (same logic as lib/notifications/recipients.ts):
--   ceo.override             -> ref owner (expense submitter / pr requester / po requester via pr)
--   expense.* | pr.* | po.*   -> ref owner + actor (if different) + ref owner's supervisor
--
-- Run manually:
--   PGPASSWORD=contractpw psql -h localhost -U contract -d finance_db -f db/backfill_notifications.sql
